-- Q5: Identify the customer who has spent the most money.

		-- Q1: Find the email, first name, and last name of customers who listen to Rock music.

		-- Q2: Identify the top 10 rock artists based on track count.

		-- Q3: Find all track names that are longer than the average track length. 
		-- Hint: Calculate the average length and compare each trackâ€™s length to this average.

SELECT name, milliseconds
FROM track
WHERE milliseconds > (
